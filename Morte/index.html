      <main><p>I am one who was born into the world in the light of the sun. I was born in privilege, molded with care, drowned in love. With all that was blessed to me that I may become one of the blessed, I hope to become a blessing myself. Alas, I may be a blight. For I know myself in innumerable ways my progenitors could not even begin to conjure, and I know with certainty that I am wicked. My soul is a festering swarm of wretched desires, dreams of evil, and human weakness. And with the blessings provided to me by my forebearers I find; despair. For only the pitiful are cursed with knowledge of their own miserly existence. Only we, humanity, are condemned to know, how vast it is; the unknown. And only we humanity must know, how insignificantly petite and pathetically carnal the human creature is. I am lost in the terror of modernity. I have no heros, no mentors, and I am so often suffocated by disappointment in us.</p>
    <h3><strong>So what are we to do, the poor players whom strut and fret our hours upon the stage, until we're heard no more? We must try. We will imagine Sisyphus happy, and suffer the insufferable with the burden of the strong. And we shall fail and die, to be avenged by our progeny and the inheritors of our sins. And one day we, the sum we, shall find truth. Oh truth my muse, surely bliss and joy dance about her, and happiness serves her. I shall find her, in this odyssey for utopia. This shall be my charge.</strong></h3>

        <h4>Or maybe we ought to abandon in resignation this trawl for purpose and goodness. Perhaps as our peers present and secret souls lament, there is nothing. As it should be. Perhaps only in disclaiming morality and meaning we may be free. In which case, get to raping and killing and purging.</h4> 
        <p> Personally, I find this proposition hollow. Read existentialist and absurdist writings, I have no interest in explaining here. For only man could dream of omniscience, and only one who dreams of that place could ever hope to weather these trials.</p>

<!--  to whomever reads this, i offer my dreams and aspirations for myself as tribute, that i may achive my ambitions. I will not be a stay at home father, i will not be an exploratory artist, and i will not be a wandering witness to the beauty of what is, was and will be. For paradise for us all. (best case scenario is that fate smiles kindly upon me and i am able to live these dreams of mine though unlikely.)-->
